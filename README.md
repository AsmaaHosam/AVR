AVR
===

Some AVR code that I wrote for my ATMEL ATMega32 based board. Code is in Assembly and C.

##Include files

The Assembly folder contains include folder that has the .inc files for all supported AVRs by the AVR assembler. They can be found in any release of AVR Studio. This one was taken from AVR Studio 5.
